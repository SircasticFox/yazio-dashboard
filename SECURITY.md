# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is a hobby project, so it does not have any releases for public usage. That means no issues with versions. The only version is the current main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project may handle personal data of the person who uses it. If you find any security leaks or related issues, please email me at alroniks+yazio@gmail.com before creating a public issue. I will acknowledge your report, conduct an investigation, and work on a resolution.
